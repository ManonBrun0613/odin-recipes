    <p>The move to your new home in the country seems to be going well: with your 
        mother in the hospital and your father buried in work,
         you are happy to cook for your family. There's nothing more enjoyable 
         and precious than sharing a good meal with the people you love.</p>

         <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>400g round rice, japonica or arborio</li>
                <li>7 small umeboshi (salted plums with vinegar)</li>
                <li>400g of edamame or fresh peas</li>
                <li>8 small smelts or 4 small sardines prepared by your fishmonger</li>
                <li>Soy sauce</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons of sakura denbu</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the rice for the bento: rinse it several times and place it in 
                    the bowl of a pressure cooker or rice cooker. Add 1.5 times the volume 
                    of water. Cook the rice for 15 minutes, until the water has evaporated 
                    completely: it should be well cooked, firm but slightly sticky. Remove 
                    it from the cooking bowl with a spatula and place it in a dish. Pit 3 
                    plums and chop them coarsely. Mix them with the hot rice, again with a 
                    wooden spatula, and let the plum rice rest covered with a cloth.</li>
                <li>To cook the edamame, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare a 
                    large bowl of ice water. Plunge the edamame into the boiling water for 
                    10 minutes, then remove them with a skimmer and plunge them into the 
                    bowl of ice water to stop them cooking.</li>
                <li>It's time to grill the smelts: heat a grill pan or the grill of your 
                    barbecue. Brush the smelts with a thin layer of soy sauce. Once your 
                    grill is hot, place the fish on it and grill for 1.5 minutes on each 
                    side. Remove them to a sheet of paper towel.</li>
                <li>Presentation: Place a bed of rice on the bottom of each bento box. 
                    In the center, place 2 grilled smelts on top of each other or 1 sardine. 
                    Spread the edamame and 1 tablespoon of sakura denbu evenly in each bento 
                    box. Finish the assembly by sticking 1 salted plum in the rice. 
                    The bentos are ready. You can serve them with a spinach salad and 
                    miso soup.</li>
