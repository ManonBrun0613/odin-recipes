    <p>Since you joined Yubaba's service, you don't have a minute to 
        yourself: you manage the bath water with old Kamaji or wash the 
        floors with Lin. Sometimes, when the night falls, you could 
        almost fall asleep without eating. However, a bite of these 
        delicious nikuman would do you a world of good!</p>

            <li>Prepare the Nikuman's dough: pour all the dry ingredients 
                into a mixing bowl. Mix them and dig a well in the center. 
                Pour in the water at once. Lightly flour your hands and 
                knead with your fingertips until you have a homogeneous 
                mixture. Flour the work surface and place the dough on it. 
                Knead until you get a smooth ball. Place the dough in 
                another bowl. Cover with a cloth and let the dough rise 
                for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>At the end of this rest, remove the cloth and press the 
                dough with your fist to degas it so that it loses its 
                volume. Flour your work surface and place the ball of 
                dough. Shape it by cutting it into 10 regular pieces. 
                Roll out each piece into a disk about 10 cm in diameter.</li>
            <li>Take a disk in the palm of your hand and place 1 teaspoon 
                of red beans in its heart. Close the disk on itself by 
                folding it into a palm. Repeat the operation for each 
                disc.</li>
            <li>Place a sheet of parchment paper in a steam basket. 
                Place the filled dough pieces on top and let them 
                rest and rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the nikuman well inflated, you can pass to 
                their cooking. Under the steam basket, bring the 
                water to a boil. Count 10min of cooking. Maintain 
                the boiling on average fire, it is not necessary 
                that the steam is too strong, it would scrape the 
                breads. At the end of the cooking, remove them from 
                the steam basket and serve them immediately.</li>
