    <p>It's not easy being a rookie witch starting a home delivery business! 
        Luckily, you sometimes work for caring and attentive customers!  One of 
        them needs you to help her bake her herring pie before delivering it: her 
        oven just broke down and she wanted to deliver this pie to her granddaughter 
        for her birthday... The pie looks delicious, why don't you ask for the recipe?</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>Main dish</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>400g of herring fillets or cod back, boned by your fishmonger</li>
            <li>500g pumpkin or kabucha</li>
            <li>2 pieces of shortcrust pastry of 200g each</li>
            <li>Butter for the mould</li>
            <li>Flour to knead the dough</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt, pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Herbs Bechamel</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A few sprigs of tarragon or flat parsley</li>
            <li>15g vegetable oil or soft butter</li>
            <li>15g of flour</li>   
            <li>1 good pinch of salt</li> 
            <li>25cl of milk or dashi</li>   
            <li>1 pinch of grated nutmeg</li>   
        </ul>

    <h4>Cooking and Presentation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg yolk + 1 tablespoon of milk</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Pepper, sansho pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the fish: salt it finely on all sides 
                and set aside in the refrigerator. The salt will 
                firm up the flesh, season it and ensure that it 
                cooks well.</li>
            <li>Move on to cooking the pumpkin: peel and skin it 
                before cutting it into cubes.
                Place them in a bamboo steamer basket or in the 
                basket of a pressure cooker. Bring a pot of water 
                to a boil and cover it with the pumpkin steamer 
                basket or place your pressure cooker on medium 
                heat. Steam for 25 minutes (15 minutes when your 
                pressure cooker starts whispering again).</li>
            <li>While the pumpkin is cooking, prepare the 
                <lang='fr>béchamel</lang> sauce: finely 
                chop the herbs. Set aside. Pour the oil or butter 
                into a saucepan and heat over medium heat. Once 
                the oil is hot, or the butter has melted, add 
                the flour and salt all at once. Mix well with a 
                wooden spatula until the mixture comes away from 
                the pan (this is called a desiccation). It is 
                important to cook the flour well. Lower the heat 
                and gradually whisk in the milk. Whisk until you 
                have a smooth mixture. Add the nutmeg and herbs 
                and adjust the seasoning. Set aside off the heat.</li>
            <li>Once cooked and very soft, place the pumpkin in a 
                bowl and season with a good pinch of salt, pepper 
                and a drizzle of olive oil. Using a potato masher 
                or a fork, mash the pumpkin until it is smooth. 
                Set aside at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Your elements are in place, move on to the preparation 
                of the dough. Preheat the oven to 180°C (TH.6). Butter 
                a baking pan. Roll out the first piece of dough on a 
                floured work surface, so that it lines the pan perfectly. 
                Remove the excess dough and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Garnish the bottom of the pie with the pumpkin crush. 
                Cover it with the fish. Sprinkle with pepper or sansho 
                pepper. Cover with <lang="fr">béchamel</lang> sauce.</li>
            <li>Lay the second piece of shortcrust pastry on a floured 
                work surface and cover the dish. Remove the excess 
                dough and join it to the previously reserved dough. 
                Join the two pieces of dough by pinching them together.</li>
            <li>Roll out the remaining dough and cut out various 
                shapes such as fish heads, scales and strips with 
                a cookie cutter or knife. Place these elements on 
                the pie. Make a hole in the eye of the fish or behind 
                the tail so that the steam in the pie can escape during 
                cooking. Finally, mix the milk with the egg yolk and 
                generously brown the pie. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes 
                depending on your oven.</li>
            <li>Presentation: serve this pie as is or with a nice fresh 
                salad, accompanied by a soy miso vinaigrette!</li>
