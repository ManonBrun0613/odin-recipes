    <h1>Howl's Moving Castle's Breakfast</h1>

    <img src="./images/hmcbreakfast.jpg" alt="Calcifer and his breakfast">

    <p>The old woman who has just joined the household tires you and intrigues 
    you at the same time: she doesn't know anything about magic or Mr. Hauru's 
    habits, whom she doesn't know either, and now she wants to prepare breakfast! 
    But she'll have to tame Calcifer!  But... she manages to control the fire
     demon and cook bacon!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Main dish</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices of smoked bacon, each 5mm thick</li>
        <li>8 large fresh eggs</li>
        <li>Pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Accompaniment</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1  loaf of homemade bread or bread purchased from the baker</li>
        <li>Black Tea</li>
        <li>Montgomery's cheddar or emmental</li>
        <li>Chives or flat leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You would think that everyone knows how to cook bacon and eggs 
            and yet! You will see that there is a trick...
            There are two things to know about this recipe: it's best to 
            use a cast iron frying pan and, as for cooking, it's best to start cold.</li>
        <li>Depending on the size of your pan, proceed in two steps, i.e. two 
            slices of bacon and 4 eggs at the same time. Place the thick slices of 
            bacon in the pan and place the pan over medium heat: the heat will 
            progressively melt the fat of the bacon. The heat will progressively 
            melt the fat of the bacon. This cooking process allows to obtain a
             melting and crispy meat on the surface. Cook the bacon for two minutes 
             before turning it over and continuing to cook.</li>
        <li>Once the bacon is well colored and cooked, you should have enough fat 
            in the pan: break the eggs into the pan and fry them for two minutes. 
            You can add pepper if you wish, but they will be naturally salted by 
            the bacon.</li>
        <li>Serve when the egg whites have coagulated and before the yolks begin 
            to harden. It should remain runny!</li>
        <li>Accompany these bacon & eggs with a nice slice of sandwich bread. 
            This is also the time to serve a thin slice of cheese, cheddar or 
            emmental, which will go perfectly with your eggs. Finally, to start 
            the day off right and give yourself a boost, accompany your meal with 
            a good cup of hot black tea (Japanese k√¥cha or Ceylon tea)!</li>
    </ol>

    <em>Tip</em> : Add chopped parsley or chives, beans, tomatoes... be creative and gourmet!
